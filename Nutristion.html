      <h2>Top Ten Nutrition Tips for Everyday Health</h2>
      <br>
<p>Here are my top ten favorite tips for healthy eating all year long.  This is by no means a complete list of guidelines but a few key things to get you started or keep you moving forward on the path toward healthy eating as a lifestyle.</p>
<p><strong>1.) </strong><strong>Drink plenty of water.<br />
</strong>Our bodies are about 60% water – with muscle mass carrying much more than fat tissue!  We need to drink water to keep our body systems running smoothly, optimize metabolism, boost energy levels, and promote good digestion, just to name a few.  Besides water, electrolytes are important especially if you exercise.</p>
<p><strong>2.) </strong><strong>Eat plenty of plants.<br />
</strong>These colorful gems provide essential phytonutrients, micronutrients, vitamins, minerals and enzymes – all of which are just as important for your health as the macronutrients we often hear about (think carbs, proteins and fats).</p>
<p><strong>3.) Eat and drink often throughout the day.<br />
</strong>The jury is still out on whether 6 small meals or 3 meals is best so try to figure out what feels right for you.  But overall, having high quality small snacks, “mini meals” or fresh juice during the day can help to boost energy and prevent over-eating.</p>
<p><strong>4.) Eat mindfully. </strong><br />
Limit distractions and take time to experience eating and engage your senses. Up to 30-40% of nutrients may not be properly absorbed if you are distracted while eating.  Like walking, watching TV, typing, working – all very common eating activities these days.  Digestion begins in the brain so by looking at, thinking about and smelling your food, you can help your body benefit from the wonderful nutrients locked away in that meal while enjoying the experience even more!</p>
<p><strong>5.) Limit processed foods.</strong><br />
Read labels carefully. Make natural, homemade versions of store-bought foods.  Like hummus or granola bars, yum!</p>
<p><strong>6.) </strong><strong>Seek local foods often and organic foods sometimes.</strong><br />
Local eating not only has more nutrients it can also save you money.  You don’t have to get everything organic if that isn’t feasible, for some items it matters more (like apples and strawberries).</p>
<p><strong>7.) Include healthy fats in your diet.</strong><br />
Eating fat doesn’t necessarily make you fat!  Many immune supportive vitamins, like Vitamin E or beta-carotene and hormones, like Vitamin D require some fat in the diet for absorption.  Pass the avocado, please!</p>
<p><strong>8.) Include healthy rich foods, including plant-based choices.</strong><br />
Protein rich foods can help to reduce reflux and keep blood sugar levels stable while supporting healthy muscles and your immune system. If you want to add more protein to your juices, chia seeds, hemp seeds, spirulina or the Reboot with Joe Protein Powder are great choices.</p>
<p><strong>9.) For weight management focus more on inclusion of healthy foods and less on restriction of portions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>10.) </strong><strong>Enjoy eating! </strong><strong><br />
