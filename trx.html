      <h2>A Little About TRX </h2>
      <br>
      <p>This fantastic and simple method of exercise can allow anyone to reach their desired goal, be it weight loss, improved muscle tone or overall fitness. Here, we outline 7 benefits of TRX suspension training, from its low impact nature to engaging your whole body.
        </p>
     <p> <strong>1. Suitable for all levels</strong><br>
      
      It doesn’t matter if you’re an Olympic athlete or just venturing into a new hobby of fitness; TRX suspension training is beneficial for all levels of athlete. Just by changing your body position slightly, the load can be increased or decreased on your muscles meaning that everyone can use this method of training.
    </p>
      
      <p><strong>2. Versatility</strong><br>
      
      Just two adjustable bands provide a comprehensive workout to every single muscle in your body. You can transport them easily and set up the TRX suspension system anywhere, so when you come back from your healthy holiday, totally addicted, you can buy your own and carry on enjoying the benefits wherever you are.
    </p>
    <p> <strong>3. Improve cardio and strength</strong><br>
      
      TRX suspension workouts will not only improve your muscle strength, but also your cardiovascular endurance. By changing the speed at which you perform the exercise, you can increase the work out you give to your heart and lungs.
    </p>
      
     <p><strong>4. Help achieve any goal</strong><br>
      
      Because of the versatility of the TRX suspension training, any goal can be achieved. You may wish to gain muscle strength, lose weight or even train for a marathon. Whatever your aim, regular TRX suspension training will get you there.
    </p>
     
      <p><strong>5. Engages whole body</strong><br>
      
      The instability that the TRX suspension system creates whilst you perform movements means that your core is constantly activated. Moreover, the functional movements mean that many muscles are worked at the same time, providing a very comprehensive, all over workout.
      
    </p>
     <p> <strong>6. Low impact nature</strong><br>
      
      Because of its suspended nature, TRX suspension training is very low impact and means that your joints are not put under much stress. In turn, this means that there is a low risk of injury, allowing you to train as hard as you wish with less risk of causing or agitating a pre-existing injury.
    </p>
     <p> <strong>7. It's different</strong><br>
      
      Sometimes the monotony of going to the gym can be tedious, and we can often struggle to keep motivated with our fitness programmes. TRX suspension training is unlike any other technique for working out and can be mixed into your normal training to liven it up. This will keep you engaged and looking forward to your sessions time and again
