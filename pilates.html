      <h2>A Little About Pilates </h2>
      <br>
 <p> Ever since Pilates was established nearly 100 years ago by Joseph Pilates of Germany, men and women alike throughout the decades have caught on to the copious benefits this low-impact exercise helps them achieve. From gaining improved inner-body connectedness to enhancing overall strength, Pilates is an asset to anyone who practices it, regardless of fitness level, body type, or age.</p>

        <p> If you’ve heard about this exciting type of exercise and have wondered why you should do Pilates, this Top 5 list of benefits should seal the deal.
        
         Refresh Your Body and Mind – When someone asks, “Why do Pilates?” one of the first benefits we cite is that it rejuvenates your body and mind. Even when you just try one session, you’ll walk away feeling centered and relaxed. This calmness and connectedness is achieved by working on proper breathing, correct spinal and pelvic alignment, and concentration on flowing, smoothing movements.</p><p> In time you’ll learn to control this movement even when not in class, allowing for ongoing rejuvenation throughout day-to-day tasks.
        Develop a Strong Core – Your “core” refers to abdominals and back. Through Pilates, you’ll strengthen muscle groups by integrating the trunk, pelvis, and shoulder girdle to achieve flat abdominals and a strong back that will not only help you look great, but will enhance your ability to perform ergonomically in a number of activities, from playing your favorite sport to tying your shoes.
    </p><p>
        Achieve Long Muscles and Flexibility – Short, bunched up muscles, acquired through more conventional weight-bearing workouts, yield tightness and minimal flexibility. You may have bulky muscles, but these short, thick muscles also are more susceptible to injury. Through practice of Pilates, you’ll learn to improve muscle elasticity and joint mobility, allowing for a balanced body that will more likely stay free from injury.
        Gain Proprioception – Beyond the five basic senses, the body contains senses known as interoceptive senses.</p><p> One of these senses is proprioception, which is the brain’s knowledge of the relative position of different parts of the body in space. Proprioception allows us to know where our bodies are when we move them, a valuable skill in almost everything we do from sports to properly lifting a box.</p><p> Pilates helps build this skill, making you a better steward of your body and health.
        Enjoy a Gentle Workout – Although Pilates is challenging and will make you sweat, in comparison to many forms of exercise it is a gentle workout. Usually performed in a reclined or sitting position, these exercises are usually low impact, focusing more on body resistance to build strength instead of all weight-bearing movements. Pilates is also exceptionally safe, making it an ideal exercise form for use in physical therapy and rehabilitation.</p>
